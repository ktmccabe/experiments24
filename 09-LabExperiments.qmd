We will sketch out the answers to these questions as a group. Along the way, we will try to build a research design for a research question we come up with as a class.

## Lab Experimental Designs

***What makes a lab experiment a lab experiment?***

***Where would we place lab experiments along the folowing dimensions:***

- Internal validity- correctness of procedures
- Construct validity- match between data and theoretical constructs
- External validity- how can results generalize to other situations

***When do you think it is best to do a lab experiment vs. a survey, field or natural experiment?***

Let's develop pros and cons of each [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H42sQrvnEVe4Sf7xQD_Z0qxNRhCRZNsNlP7oRQyfPhQ/edit?usp=sharing)


Falk and Heckman note: ***"Observing behavior in the field is in general not more interesting or informative than observing behavior in the lab." Reactions?***

From Kim (2023), ***What makes a lab-in-the-field experiment unique? Are there tradeoffs with this approach***
